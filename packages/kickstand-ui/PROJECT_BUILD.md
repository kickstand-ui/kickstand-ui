# Kickstand UI

Kickstand UI is a design system for building web applications. It is built using native web components to ensure its cross-platform compatibility.

## Running the Project

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run Storybook:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components:

```bash
npm test
```

Run basic dev mode (should rarely be used):

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Solution Architecture

This design system is built using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) (a compiler for building native web components) and [Clarion](https://projectclarion.com) (a CSS framework for building design systems).

Components are built and tested using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
