The Themes folder contains third-party themes for your website and for things like styles for plugins. This folder has been added higher in the architecture so that if you would like to create customizations, you can do so in the subsequent folders like Components, Layouts, and Pages. This will allow you to override the theme's rules without modifying the theme directly and ruining the integrity of the code.
