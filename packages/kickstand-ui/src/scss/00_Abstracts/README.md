# Abstracts

This folder is for your style tools and helpers used across the project. Your reusable code such as global variables, functions, mixins and placeholders should be put in here.

The code contained in this folder should not be code that outputs CSS directly.

With larger projects you may want to break this into subdirectories like variables, functions, and mixins. Subdirectories are supported in the Clarion CLI.
