## Showing and Hiding

If you are using the [`<ks-button>` element](/components/button.html) you can take advantage of the `shows` and `hides` properties to open and close any of the components built using the [overlay](/components/overlay.html) component.

<div class="my-xl">
    <ks-button shows="button_drawer">Show Drawer using Button</ks-button>
    <ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="button_drawer">
        <ks-button class="" hides="button_drawer">Close</ks-button>
    </ks-side-drawer>
</div>

```html
<ks-button shows="button_drawer">Show Drawer using Button</ks-button>
<ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="button_drawer">
    <ks-button hides="button_drawer">Close</ks-button>
</ks-side-drawer>
```

You can also programmatically show and hide side-drawers. It is as simple as using JavaScript to select the element and call the `show()` or `hide()` methods. Here is a simple example that will show the side-drawer when the button is clicked and hide it after 3 seconds.

<div class="my-xl">
    <ks-button id="test_button">Show Drawer</ks-button>
    <ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="test_drawer">
        <p>I will close in 3 seconds...</p>
    </ks-side-drawer>
    <script>
        let testButton = document.getElementById('test_button');
        let testDrawer = document.getElementById('test_drawer');
        testButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
            testDrawer.show();
            setTimeout(function() {
                testDrawer.hide();
            }, 3000);
        });
    </script>
</div>

```html
<ks-button id="test_button">Show Drawer</ks-button>
<ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="test_drawer">
    <p>I will close in 3 seconds...</p>
</ks-side-drawer>
<script>
    let testButton = document.getElementById('test_button');
    let testDrawer = document.getElementById('test_drawer');

    // add click event listener to button
    testButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // show loading overlay
        testDrawer.show();

        // hide after 3 seconds
        setTimeout(function() {
            testDrawer.hide();
        }, 3000);
    });
</script>
```
