## Showing and Hiding

If you are using the [`<ks-button>` element](/components/button.html) you can take advantage of the `shows` and `hides` properties to open and close any of the components built using the [overlay](/components/overlay.html) component.

<div class="my-xl">
    <ks-button shows="button_drawer">Show Drawer using Button</ks-button>
    <ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="button_drawer">
        <ks-button class="" hides="button_drawer">Close</ks-button>
    </ks-side-drawer>
</div>

```html
<ks-button shows="button_drawer">Show Drawer using Button</ks-button>
<ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="button_drawer">
    <ks-button hides="button_drawer">Close</ks-button>
</ks-side-drawer>
```

You can also programmatically show and hide side-drawers. It is as simple as using JavaScript to select the element and call the `show()` or `hide()` methods. Here is a simple example that will show the side-drawer when the button is clicked and hide it after 3 seconds.

<div class="my-xl">
    <ks-button id="test_button">Show Drawer</ks-button>
    <ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="test_drawer">
        <p>I will close in 3 seconds...</p>
    </ks-side-drawer>
    <script>
        (function(){
            let testButton = document.getElementById('test_button');
            let testDrawer = document.getElementById('test_drawer');
            testButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                testDrawer.show();
                setTimeout(function() {
                    testDrawer.hide();
                }, 3000);
            });
        })();
    </script>
</div>

```html
<ks-button id="test_button">Show Drawer</ks-button>
<ks-side-drawer header-text="Basic Drawer" id="test_drawer">
    <p>I will close in 3 seconds...</p>
</ks-side-drawer>
<script>
    let testButton = document.getElementById('test_button');
    let testDrawer = document.getElementById('test_drawer');

    // add click event listener to button
    testButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // show loading overlay
        testDrawer.show();

        // hide after 3 seconds
        setTimeout(function() {
            testDrawer.hide();
        }, 3000);
    });
</script>
```

## Accessibility

The side-drawer component is built using the [`<ks-overlay>`](/components/overlay.html) component and inherits accessibility features from that such as:

- The side-drawer has the `role="dialog"` to help assistive technology identify the side-drawer's content as being grouped and separated from the rest of the page content.
- When opened, the focus will be set on the first clickable element within the side-drawer.
- The element that triggered the side-drawer will have the attribute `aria-expanded="true"` automatically added.
- When the user tabs, the focus will stay isolated within the side-drawer to prevent elements outside the side-drawer from being selected.
- When the side-drawer is closed, the focus will go back to the element the user was on before the side-drawer was opened so they do not lose their place in the document.
- Once the side-drawer is closed, the element that triggered the side-drawer will have the attribute `aria-expanded="true"` automatically added.
- The side-drawer title will be used to label the side-drawer using the `aria-labelledby` attribute.
- The side-drawer can be closed using the `esc` key for keyboard users.
- If you are using the `shows` and `hides` controls on the `<ks-button>` component, the button will automatically be populated with the appropriate `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` attributes on the button.
