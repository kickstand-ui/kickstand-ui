# Installation

## Package Manager

# or

yarn install kickstand-ui
```

### Add To Your Project

```js
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from 'kickstand-ui/loader';

// Apply the polyfills and bind the custom elements to the window object
applyPolyfills().then(() => {
    defineCustomElements();
});
```

### Styles

Kickstand UI was written using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and to take advantage of all of the built-in tooling and customization capabilities you should plan on using it in your project. You can import them into your project from `kickstand-ui/src/scss/styles.scss`. If not you can always use the compiled CSS located in `kickstand-ui/dist/kickstand-ui/kickstand-ui.css`.
